# InvBot
**The task:** create a simple investment telegram-bot with basic features.

**The solution:** We created a small cute telegram-bot which may be useful for narrow group of users. 

There are some features:

**1. Investment ideas.** Here you may enter your personal investment ideas. Users of your bot can get and read those ideas in a cozy way.<br> 
**2. Markets overview.** Here you can enter your personal market analysis. That feature is called "Market conditions".<br>
**3. Financials.**. Here users of your bot can get some financial data entering ticker they like (for example AAPL). Financial data is getting downloaded from Yahoo Finance free API. Also InvBot is making some simple analytics of main numbers. Note that free tiers of such APIs are made for personal use only and have hard limits.<br>
**4. What's new?** This feature is made for users to get any news about your bot development.<br>

Those features are simple, but are made in a nice and useful way. InvBot functionality is modest, but may be significantly improved if needed. InvBot is more like sample-bot not the latest product version.

InvBot was working on Heroku infrastructure in Spring 2023 and later had been turned off.

**Disclaimer:** All analysis in the bot is not a personal investment advice and was entered as an example. You should manage your risks carefully, the authors and developers are not responsible for your losses.
